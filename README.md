==============

Work in progress library for manipulating Mac OS memory
--------------

* Works using the Mach VM API provided by apple (but they give no reference on how to use it for some reason...).

** Future plans **
- Give same functionality as Cheat Engine
- Completely emulate vmmap
- Hook and manipulate functions
