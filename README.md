Work in progress library for manipulating Mac OS memory
--------------

* Works using the Mach VM API provided by Apple (but they give no reference on how to use it for some reason...).
* Will hopefully help me learn how stuff works while also being useful library for the future

# **Future plans**
- Give same functionality as Cheat Engine
- Completely emulate vmmap
- Hook and manipulate functions
